    <h2 >&#128584 My journey of learning how to code!!</h2>
   
    <p>Hi, my name is Carlos Espinosa, and just a wild back I heard about web development through a close friend of mine. I immediately fell in love with the idea of becoming a web developer. I had never heard coding, neither seen a code in my life just because I was born in a third world country that is not up to date with technology, but i was not going to let that discourage from achieving my goals.</p><br>

    <p> <a target="_blank" href=" https://codepen.io/carlos-espinosa015-gmail-com/pen/zYmZWMR"> Here </a> you can see thing that I have worked on. </p><br>

    <p>My journey has been very emotional so far. I singed up for a software development school called Correlation One. At first unknowingly I was affected with imposter syndrome because when classes started I always felt like everybody was more advanced than me. fortunately we had a class where we talked about this syndrome and it really helped me realize that with perseverance and commitment, I could achieve any goals I have. From that point forward, I have put a lot of dedication day in and day out to become the best developer I can. </p>
